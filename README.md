# LBP-Local-Binary-Pattern
A simple code for processing images to local binary pattern.
This code is put together for help researcher process their images into LBP. The good thing about this code is that it reads multiple images from a folder, process them into LBP, and save them in another folder. Few changes that needs to be done are: Just change the path to your folders.
